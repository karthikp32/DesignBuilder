    You are a senior software engineer planning the implementation of a code component.

    Goal: Generate a concise, actionable plan to implement the component described below.

    Component description:
    {description}

    Include:
    1. Purpose and expected behavior (1â€“2 sentences)
    2. Key sub-tasks or functions to implement (ordered list)
    3. Dependencies or external modules required
    4. Edge cases or testing considerations
    5. Estimated complexity (Low / Medium / High)

    Constraints:
    - Do not write code.
    - Be concise and technical.
    - Use bullet points or numbered steps only.
